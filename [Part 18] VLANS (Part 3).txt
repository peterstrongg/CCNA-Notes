Native VLAN on a Router (ROAS):
	- "encapsulation dot1q vlan-id native"
	- Configure the IP address for the native VLAN on the router's physical interface

Layer 3 / Multilayer switches:
	- Switching and routing
	- Layer 3 aware
	- Can assign IPs to interfaces, like a router
	- You can create virtual interfaces for each VLAN
	- Can configure routes
	- Can be used for inter-VLAN routing
	- Preferred method for inter-VLAN routing in large networks
	- "ip routing" IMPORTANT
		- Enables L3 routing on the switch
	- "no switchport"
		- Allows you to assign IPs to switch ports
	
SVI (Switch Virtual Interfaces)
	- Can assign IPs to in multilayer switches
	- Configure PCs to use the SVI (Not the router) as their gateway address
	- Switch will route the traffic
	- To send data to the internet, configure a default route on one of the interfaces (usually connected to a router)
	- "interface vlan10"
	- "ip address <ip> <subnet mask>"
	- "no shutdown"
