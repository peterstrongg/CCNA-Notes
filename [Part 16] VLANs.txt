What is a LAN?:
	- A single broadcast domain, including all devices in that broadcast domain
	
VLANs:
	- Lots of unnecessary broadcast traffic can reduce network performance
	- Security concerns, only certain PCs should be able to access certain subnets
	- VLANs operate at layer 2 (switch interfaces)
	- Separate end hosts at layer 2
	- Switches do not forward directly between hosts in different VLANs
		- Must forward traffic through router
		
VLAN Configuration:
	- "show vlan brief"
	- VLANS 1, 1002-1005 can not be deleted
	- Configuration steps:
		- "interface range <iface range>"
		- "switchport mode access"
			- an access port is a switchport that belongs to a single VLAN
			- switch ports which carry multiple VLANs are called 'trunk ports'
		- "switchport access vlan 10" adds ifaces to vlan
	- "vlan <name>" creates a vlan, also enters config mode for that vlan
	- "name <name>
	- " assign vlan name
	
	
* Default switchport mode is auto
