STP States:
	- Blocking (Stable):
		- Non-designated ports
		- Effectively disabled to prevent loops
		- Do not send/receive regular traffic
		- Do receive STP BPDUs
		- Do not forward BPDUs
		- Do not learn MAC addresses
	- Listening (Transitional):
		- Only designated and root ports
		- Leads to the forwarding states (15 seconds)
		- Only forwards STP BPDUs, NOT regular traffic
		- Does not learn MAC addresses
	- Learning (Transitional):
		- 15 Seconds long
		- Only forwards BPDUs, not regular traffic
		- Does learn MAC addresses from regular traffic
	- Forwarding (Stable)
		- Root/Designated ports
		- Operates as normal
		- Sends regular and STP BPDU traffic
		- Learns MAC addresses
		
Spanning Tree Timers:
	- Hello (2 Sec):
		- How often the root bridge sends hello BPDUs
	- Forward Delay (15 sec):
		- How long the switch will stay in the listening and 
		learning states
	- Max Age (20 sec (10*Hello)):
		- How long an interface will wait after ceasing to receive
		Hello BPDUs to change the STP topology
		
* A forwarding state may go directly into Blocking state but, a blocking state
must go through the listening and learning states before forwarding to prevent 
loops

PVST  = only ISL
	- Dst MAC Address: 0180.c200.0000
PVST+ = ISL and 802.1Q
	- Dst MAC Address: 01:00:0c:cc:cc:cd
	
STP Toolkit:
	- Portfast:
		- For ports connected to endhosts
		- Allos oprt to move immediately to forwarding state
			- Must be used only on end-hosts
		- "spanning-tree portfast" 
		
BPDU Guard:
	- "spanning-tree bpduguard enable"
	- If an interface with BPDU guard enabled receives a BPDU from another switch, 
	the interface will be shut down to prevent a loop from forming
	
Root Guard:
	- Even if a switch receives a superiour BPDU, the switch will not accept
	the new switch as the root bridge. The interface will be disabled

Loop Guard:
	- Even if an interface stops receiving BPDUs, it will not start forwarding


Spanning Tree Mode:
	- "spanning-tree mode <mst, pvst, rapid-pvst>"
	- "spanning-tree vlan <vlan number> root primary"
		- sets the STP priority to 24576. If another switch already has a priority
		lower than 24576, it sets this priority to 4096 less than the other switches priority
	"spanning-tree vlan <vlan number> root secondary"
		- sets priority to 28672
