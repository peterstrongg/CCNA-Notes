802.1W - Rapid STP
802.1S - Multiple STP

RSTP Costs:
	10 Mbps		2,000,000
	100 Mbps	200,000
	1 Gbps		20,000
	10 Gbps 	2000
	100 Gbps	200
	1 Tbps		20
	
RSTP Port States:
	- Discarding State
	- Learning State
	- Forwarding State

Port Roles:
	- Root Port
	- Designated Port
	- Alternate Port
		- Discarding Port that receives a superior BPDU from another switch
		- Backup to the root port
	- Backup Port
		- Discarding port that receives a superior BPDU
		- This only happens when two interfaces are connected to the same collision domain
		- Backup for a designated port
		
"spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst" 

RPVST BPDU:
	- RSTP Protocol V2
	- V0 for Classic STP
	
* In RSTP, All switches originate BPDUS from their designated ports
	
RSTP Link Types:
	- Edge
		- Connected to End hosts, move straight to forwarding state
		- Similar to Portfast
		- "spanning-tree portfast"
	- Point to Point
		- Connected to another switch
		- Full-duplex
		- Don't need to configure the iface (it should be detected)
		- "spanning-tree link-type point-to-point
	- Shared Ports
		- Connected to a hub
		- Half-duplex
		- Detected by switch
		- "spanning-tree link-type shared"
