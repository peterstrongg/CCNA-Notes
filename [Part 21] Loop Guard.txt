* Protects networks from Loops by disabling a port if it unexpectedly stops receiving
BPDUS, ensuring it does not mistakenly enter the forwarding state

Unidirectional Link: A network link where data transmission only occurs in one direction:
	- Damaged cables
	- Faulty connectors or transcievers
	- Fiber is more susceptible to errors
		- two wires (Tx and Rx)

Loop Guard:
	- When a Loop Guard enabled ports Max Age timer counts down to 0, it doesn't become a Designated port
	and start transitioning to Forwarding
		- It enters the Broken (Loop Inconsistent) State
		- This blocks the port
	- "spanning-tree guard loop"
	- "spanning-tree loopguard default"
		- Enables on all ports
		- "spanning-tree guard none"
	- Usually should be enabled on Root and Non-Designated ports (Receive BPDUs)
	
Loop Guard w/ Root Guard:
	- Cannot be enabled on the same port at the same timer
	- Mutually Exclusive
	- Most specific commands take effect
