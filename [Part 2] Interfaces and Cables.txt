RJ-45 (RJ = Registered Jack)
	- Used on the end of a copper ethernet cable
	- 8 pins

Ethernet:
	- A collection of network protocols/standards
	
Bits: 0 or 1
Byte: 8 bits
Speed is measured in bits per second
1 Kb = 1000 bits
1 Mb = 1000000 bits
1 Gb = 1 Billion bits
1 Tb = 1 Trillion bits

IEEE 802.3 standards
IEEE = Inistitute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
Max length of twisted pair cable: 100m

UTP Standards
Speed		Common Name			IEEE Standard		Informal Name		Wire Ct.			Max Length
10 Mbps		Ethernet			802.3i				10BASE-T			2 pairs (4 wires)	100m
100 Mpbs	Fast Ethernet		802.3u				100BASE-T			2 pairs (4 wires)	100m
1 Gbps		Gigabit Ethernet	802.3ab				1000BASE-T			4 pairs (8 wires)	100m
10 Gbps		10 Gig Ethernet		802.3.an			10GBASE-T			4 pairs (8 wires)	100m

Cables:
	UTP Cables:
		- Unshielded Twisted Pair
		- Twist protects against EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)
		- Tx = Transmit
		- Rx = Receive
		10/100BASE-T:
			PCs, Firewalls, and Routers:
				- Pins 1 and 2: Tx/Rx
				- Pins 3 and 6: Rx/Tx
			* Switches transmit on 3/6 and receive on 1/2
			* Straight-through cable (pin 1 -> pin 1, pin 2 -> pin 2, etc.)
			* Cannot connect router to router, switch to switch, pc to pc, etc. with straight through cable
				* Same devices receive and transmit on same pins
			* Crossover cable:
				- 1/2 -> 3/6 and 3/6 and 1/2
				- can be used to connect same network devices together
		- Auto MDI-X: Automatically determine which pins Tx and Rx between devices
		1000/10GBASE-T:
			- Pairs: 1/2, 3/6, 4/5, 7/8
			- All pairs are bidirectional
			
Fiber-Optic Connections:
	- SFP Transceiver (Small Form-Factor Pluggable)
	- Send light over glass wires
	- Two wires, one for Tx and one for Rx
	Layers of Fiber Cable:
		1. Fiberglass Core
		2. Cladding that reflects light
		3. Protective buffer
		4. Outer jacket of cable
	
	Multimode Fiber
		- Core of mulitfiber is wider than single-mode fiber
		- Allows longer cables than UTP but shorter than single-mode fiber
		- Cheaper than single-mode Fiber (Use cheaper LED based SFP transmitters
	
	Single-Mode Fiber
		- Narrower than multimode fiber
		- Light enters at a single angle from laser based transmitters
		- Longer cables than UTP and multimode cables
		- Most expensive due to laser tramsitter

Fiber-Optic Cable Standards
Informal Name			IEEE Standard		Speed		Cable Type		Max-Length
1000BASE-LX				802.3z				1 Gbps		Multi/Single	550m(mm)/5km(sm)
10GBASE-SR				802.3ae				10Gbps		Multi			400m
10GBASE-LR				802.3ae				10Gbps		Single			10km
10GBASE-ER				802.3ae				10Gbps		Single			30km

UTP 														Fiber Optic
- Cheaper													- Expensive
- Shorter distance											- Longer distance
- Vulnerable to EMI											- Not vuln to EMI
- RJ45 Ports												- SFP ports
- Emit faint signal which can be copied (Security risk)		- Do not emit faint signal
