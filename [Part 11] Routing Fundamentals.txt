Routing:
	- The process that routers use to determine the path that IP packets should take over a network to reach their destination
	- Routers store routes to all known destinations in a routing table
	- Two main methods:
		- Dynamic Routing:
			- OSPF to share routing informatoin with eachotehr automatically and build their routing tables
		- Static Routing:
			- A network engineer/admin manually configures routes on the router
	
	- WAN: A network that extends over a large geographical area
	- "show ip route" - shows routing table 
	- Connected "C" Routes:
		- Route to the network that the interface is connected to
		- R1 G0/2 IP = 192.168.1.0/24
		- Provides a route to all hosts in that network
	- Local  "L" Routes:
		- The exact IP address configured on the interface
		- A /32 netmask is used to specify the exact address of the interface
		
Route Selection:
	- Routers choose the most specific matching route
		- Longest prefix length/Fewer IPs = more specific, /32 is the most specific
