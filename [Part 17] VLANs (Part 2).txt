Trunk Ports:
	- When a number of VLANs increases, using one interface per network is not feasible
	- Trunk ports carry traffic from multiple VLANS over a single interface
	- Switches tag all frames they send over a trunk link
	- Frames sent over trunk ports are tagged
	- Access ports are untagged ports

VLAN Tagging:
	- Trunking protocols:
		- IEEE 802.1Q
		- ISL (Inter-Switch Link)
			- Old Cisco Protocol
	
	- 802.1Q:
		- Header is placed between Source MAC and type fields in ethernet header
		- 4 bytes in length:
			- Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)
			- Tag Control Information (TCI)
		- TCI has 3 sub-fields
		- TPID (16 bits)
			- 0x8100 (indicates the frame is 802.1Q tagged
		- TCI:
			- PCP (Priority Code Point)
				- 3 bits
				- CoS (Class of Service) prioritizes important traffic in congested networks
			- DEI (Drop Eligible Indicator)
				- 1 bit
				- Indicate frames that can be dropped if the network is congested
			- VID (VLAN ID)
				- 12 bits
				- Identifies the VLAN the frame belongs to
				- 12 bits = 4096 total VLANS (2^12) 0-4095
					- 0 and 4095 are reserved
					- 1-4094 is the actual range

VLAN Ranges: 
	- 1-1005: Normal Ranges
	- 1006-4094: Extended VLANS

Native VLAN:
	- VLAN 1 by default on all trunk ports
	- No 802.1Q tag is not added to frames in native vlans
	- When a switch receives an untagged frame on a trunk port, it assumes the frame belongs to the native VLAN
		* NATIVE VLAN MUST MATCH ACROSS SWITCHES
	- For security purposes, the native vlan should be an unused vlan
	- "switchport trunk native vlan <vlan number>" change native vlan
		
Configuring Trunk Ports:
	- All VLANs are allowed on a trunk by default
	- "switchport mode trunk"
		- "switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q" (sometimes necessary to create trunk)
	- "show interfaces trunk"
	- "switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,30" allows vlans on trunk
	- "switchport trunk allowed vlan add 20" adds 20 to allowed vlans
	- "switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 20" removes 20 to allowed vlans
	- all and except are also options for configuring trunks
	- "show vlan brief" does not show trunk port and associated interfaces
		- use "show interfaces trunk" to show trunk and interfaces

ROAS (Router on a Stick):
	- Used to route between multiple VLANs using a single interface on the router and switch
	- Switch interface is configured as regular trunk
	- Router iface is configured using subinterfaces
	- G0/0.10, G0/0.20, etc. for sub interfaces. Value after decimal should represent vlan number
	- "interface g0/0.10"
	- "encapsulation dot1q <vlan number>" treat traffic with this tag as if it arrived on interface that you are configing
	- "ip address <ip> <mask>"
