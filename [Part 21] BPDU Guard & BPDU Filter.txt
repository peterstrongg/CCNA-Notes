BPDU Guard: 
	- Protects the network from unauthorized switches being connected to ports intended for end hosts
	- Configured separately from Portfast but usually used together
	- If a BPDU guard enabled port receives a BPDU, it enters the error-disabled state, disabling the port
	
Configuration:
	- Per Port:
		- "spanning-tree bpduguard enable"
	- Globally:
		- "spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default"
		- activated on all portfast enabled ports only
			- NOT all access ports
			
Fixing ErrDisable:
	- Fix the underlying issue
	- "shutdown" then "no shutdown"
	- ErrDisable Recovery:
		- "show errdisable recovery"
		- 5 minute timer
		- "errdisable recovery cause bpduguard"
		
BPDU Filter:
	- Sending BPDUs to hosts is unnecessary and undesirable:
		- BPDUS contain information about the LAN's STP topology
	- Stops port from sending BPDUs

Configuration:
	- "spanning-tree bpdufilter enable"
		- Port will not send BPDUs
		- Will ignore BPDUs it receives
		- Disables STP on the Port
			- Could cause loops. Use with caution
	- "spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default"
		- Better than per-port
