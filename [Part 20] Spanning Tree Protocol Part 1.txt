Broadcast Storms:
	- Ethernet header does not have TTL
	- Broadcast frames can flood network
	- MAC address Flapping
	
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):
	- Classic STP (IEEE 802.1D)
	- Switches from all vendors run STP
	- STP rpevents layer 2 loops by placing redundant ports in a blocking state
	- These ifaces act as backups that can enter a forwarding state if an active iface fails
	- ifaces in forwarding state behave normally
	- ifaces in blocking state only send or receive STP messages (called BPDUS (Bridge Protocol Data Units))
		- Bridge = Switch
	- By selecting which ports are forwarding and which ports are blocking, STP creates a single path to/from
	each point in the network. Preventing layer 2 loops
	
STP Process:
	- STP-enabled switches send/receive Hello BPDUs out of all interfaces, default every 2 seconds
	- If a switch receives a Hello BPDU, it knows that interface is connected to another switch
	- Switches use one field in the STP BPDU, the Bridge ID field, to elect a root bridge for the network.
	- The switch with the lowest Bridge ID becomes the root bridge
	- All ports on the root bridge are put in the forwarding state. Other swtiches must have a path to reach
	the root bridge

BPDU (Bridge ID):
	- Bridge Priority (16 bits)
		- Bridge Priority (4 bits)
			- Default priority is 32768
			- Can only change by values of 4096 without changing vlan
		- Extended System ID (VLAN ID) (12 bits)
		
	- MAC Address (48 bits)
	
	* By default, the switch with the lowest MAC address becomes the root bridge
	
Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST):
	- STP instance in each VLAN so different interfaces on a switch can be forwarding or blocking

Spanning Tree Costs:
	10Mbps: 	100
	100Mbps:	19
	1Gbps:		4
	10Gbps:		2
	
Root Ports:
	- Closest to the root bridge
	- Path to the root bridge
	- Ports connected to the root port must be designated
	
Root Cost:
	- Sum of all outgoing interfaces on its way to the root switch 
	
Designated Ports:
	- Non-root port that forwards traffic away from the root bridge 
	- Only designated ports forward BPDUs

Summary: 
	1) One switch is elected as the root bridge. All ports on the root bridge are designated ports (Forwarding state)
	Root Bridge Selection
		- Lowest Bridge ID
		- MAC address tie breaks
		
	2) Each remaining switch will select ONE of its interfaces to be its root port (Forwarding state)
	Ports across from the root port are always designated ports
	Root port selection:
		1. Lowest root cost
		2. Lowest neighbor bridge ID (Incl. MAC Address)
		3. Lowest neighbor port ID
			- "show spanning-tree" 
			- "show spanning-tree detail"
	
	3) Each remaing collision domain will select ONE interface to be a designated port. The other port in the
	collision domain will be the non-designated port
	Designated Port selection:
		1. Iface on switch with the lowest cost
		2. Interface on switch with lowest bridge ID
