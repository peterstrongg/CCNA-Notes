DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol):
	- Cisco Propietary protocol that allows Cisco switches to
	dynamically determine their interface status (access or trunk)
	- Enabled by default
	- Manual config is recommended, DTP should be disabled
	- "switchport mode dynamic <auto or desirable>"
		- Desirable will actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco switches
		also is the default mode on older switches
		- Auto is more passive
	- "switchport nonegotiate" disables DTP
	
VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol):
	- Allows you to configure VLANS ona central VTP server switch, and other switches (VTP clients)
	will sync their database to thes erver
	- Rarely used
	- versions 1, 2, 3
	- SERVER, client and transparent
	- "show vtp status"

VTP Servers:
	- Can add/modify/delete VLANS
	- Stored in non-volatile RAM
	- Advertise latest version of database on trunk ports
	- Default mode

VTP Clients:
	- Cannot add/modify/delete VLANS
	- Will advertise and forward database to other clients on trunk ports 
	- "vtp mode client"
	
VTP Transparent Mode:
	- Do not participate in VTP domain
	- Maintaines its own VLAN database in NVRAM
	- Will forward ads that are in the same domain
	- Rev number is 0
	
* "vtp domain <domain name>"
* "vtp version <version number>"
	- increase rev number

VTP versions:
	- 1:
		- 
	- 2:
		- supports token ring VLANS
	- 3: 
		- Allows all vlans beyond default VLANS (1-1005)
