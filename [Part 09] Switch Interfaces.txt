CLI:
	- "show ip interface brief" to show interfaces
	- "show interfaces status" 

* Switch interfaces do not have shutdown status by default
	- up/up if connected to another device
	- down/down if not connected to another device

Configuring Interfaces:
	- "speed <speed>"
	- "duplex <auto, full, half>"
	- "description <desc>"
	- Disabling interfaces
		- "interface range f0/5 - 6, f0/9 - 12"
		- "shutdown"
		- optional description
		
Full-Duplex - Can send and recieve at the same time
Half-Duplex - Cannot send and recieve at the same time (must alternate)
	- Hubs 
		- Rudimentary switch
		- all frames are flooded
		- Collision domain
		CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection):
			- Before sending frames devices listen to the collision domain until they detect that other devices are not sending
			- If a collision does occur, device sends a jamming signal to inform the other devices that a collision happened
			- Each device waits a random period of time
			
			
Speed/Duplex Autonegotiation
	- ifaces that can run at different speeds have default settings of speed auto and duplex auto
	- ifaces advertise their capabilities to the neighboring device, and they negotiate the best speed
	duplex setting sthey are both capable of
	- Autonegotiation is disabled?
		- The switch will sense the speed
		- If speed is not detected it will use the slowest
		- 10/100 = half duplex (NO MATTER WHAT)
			- Can cause duplex mismatch (collisions will occur)

Interface Errors ("show interfaces"):
	- Runts: frames smaller than min frame size (64 bytes)
	- Giants: Bigger than max size (1518 bytes)
	- CRC: Frames that failed CRC (in Eth FCS trailer)
	- Frame: Frames that have an incorrect format (due to an error)
	- Input errors: Total of counters
	- Output errors: Frames the switch tried to send but failed
