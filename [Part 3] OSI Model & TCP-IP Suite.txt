Networking Models:
	- Categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards

OSI Model - Open Systems Interconnection Model
	- Created by the International Organization Standarization (ISO)
	- Encapsulation and De-encapsulation
	- PDUs (Protocol Data Units)
		- Data
		- Segment
		- Packet
		- Frame
		- Bit (L1)

	7. Application (HTTP, HTTPS)
		- Closest to end user
		- Interacts with software
		- Identify communication partners
		- Process-to-process
	6. Presentation
		- Translate between app and network formats
		- Encryption/decryption of data
		- Translates between app layer formats
	5. Session
		 - Controls dialogues/sessions between hosts
		 - Establishes, manages, and terminates connections between local app and remote app
	* DATA
	4. Transport
		- L4 header is added on to each segment
		- Segments and reassembles data for communications between end hosts
		- Breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments for easier transmission
		- Host-to-host communication
	* SEGMENT
	3. Network
		- L3 Header is added
		- Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks
		- Provides logical addressing
		- Path selection between source and destination
		- Routers
	* PACKET
	2. Data Link
		- L2 header and trailer
		- Provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer
		- Define how data is formatted for transmission over physical medium
		- Detects and corrects physical layer errors
		- Layer 2 addressing, separate from Layer 3
		- Switches
	* FRAME
	1. Physical
		- Defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices
		- Voltage levels, max transmission distances, conectors, cable specifications, etc. 
		- Digital bits are converted into electrical or radio
	* BITS
		
	- Acronym
		- Please
		- Do
		- Not
		- Teach 
		- Students
		- Pointless 
		- Acronyms
		
TCP/IP Suite
	- Set of communications protocols used in the internet and other networks
	- Similar to OSI with fewer layers
	
	4. Application
	3. Transport
	2. Internet - Network Layer in OSI
	1. Link - Physical and Data Link in OSI
	
	- OSI model is used to communicate issues in a network
