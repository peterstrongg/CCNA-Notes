Ethernet Frame
	- The Preamble + SFD is usually not considered as part of the ethernet header
	- The minimum size for an Ethernet frame is 64 Bytes
	- Therefore, min. payload is 46 Bytes
	- Payloads less than 46 bytes contain padding to fill in the difference
	- Packets contain src and destination IP addresses
	
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
	- Used to discover the Layer 2 Address (MAC) of a known Layer 3 address (IP Address)
	- Two messages:
		- ARP Request
			- Broadcast ethernet frame (sent to all hosts on network)
		- ARP Replay
			- Unicast ethernet frame (Sent back to ARP requester)
			
	- In an ARP Request, the destination MAC Address is FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
	- ARP Type: 0x0806

ARP Table: 
	- (arp -a) to view ARP table, "show arp" (Cisco IOS from Priveleged EXEC mode)
	- static ARP entry: default entry
	- dynamic ARP entry: Learned via ARP
	
Ping: 
	- network utility to test reachability
	- Measures round-trip time
	- uses two messages
		- ICMP echo request
		- ICMP echo reply
		* ICMP requires arp entry to be present first, therefore ARP must be run before ICMP because the host must be known
		
MAC Address Table:
	- "show mac address-table"
	- Aging (MAC Address disappear after 5 mins of inactivity
	- Removing MAC Addresses
		- "clear mac address-table dynamic" clears all dynamic MACs
		- "clear mac address-table dynamic address <address>" clears specific dynamic MAC
		- clear mac address-table dynamic interface <iface>" clears MACs associated with specific interface
