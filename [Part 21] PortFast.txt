Portfast:
	- Default takes 30 secs before port can send/receive data
	- Portfast solves this ^
	- Ports with portfast enabled are immediately in forwarding state
	- "spanning-tree portfast"
		- Only for individual interface
	- "spanning-tree portfast default"
		- Enables portfast on all access ports
	- Portfast should not be enabled on interfaces that connect to other switches
	- Will not be "active" on trunking ports
	- "show spanning-tree interface <iface-id> detail"
	- "spanning-tree portfast disable"
	
PortFast on Trunk Ports:
	- Sometimes you may want to enable portfast on trunk ports:
		- A port connected to a virtualization server with VMs in different VLANs
		- A port connected to a router via ROAS
	- Can only be configged per iface-id
	- "spanning-tree portfast trunk"
