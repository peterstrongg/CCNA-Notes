LAN (Local Area Network):
	- PDUs (Protocol Data Units)

Ethernet Frame:
	- Ethernet Header
		- Preamble
			- 7 bytes
			- Alternating 1s and 0s
				- Allows devices to synchronize their receiver clocks
		- SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)
			- 1 byte
			- 10101011
			- Marks the end of the Preamble
		- Destination & Source
			- Indicate the devices sending and receiving frame
			- Dest and source MAC addresses (Media Access Control)
			- 6 bytes each
		- Type (IPv4 or IPv6) or Length
			- 2 bytes
			- Value less then 1500 indicates the LENGTH of packet
			- Value of 1536 or greater indicates the TYPE (IPv4 or IPv6). Length is determine via other methods
				- IPv4 = 0x0800 (hex) 2048 in decimal
				- IPv6 = 0x86DD (hex) 34525 in decimal
	- Packet
	- Ethernet Trailer
		- Frame Check Sequence
			- 4 bytes
			- Detects corrupted data by running a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) algorithm over the received data
			
	- Header + Trailer = 26 bytes

Hexadecimal:
	- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

MAC Addresses (Media Access Control):
	- 6 byte physical address assigned to the device when it is made
	- A.K.A (BIA) Burned-in address
	- Globally unique
	- First 3 bytes are OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) assigned to the company making the device
	- Last 3 bytes are unique to the device itself
	- Written as 12 hexadecimal characters
	- Dynamically Learned MAC Address:
		- Switches keep a MAC Address table that update as src destinations come in
	- Unknown Unicast Frame - Switch doesnt have an entry for this destination in MAC Address table
		- If this happens, switch FLOODs (sends to all interfaces except source)
	- Known Unicast Frame - Entry is already in MAC table
	- MAC address table entries are cleared after 5 minutes of inactivity
