* Prevents a port from becoming a Root Port by disabling it if superior BPDUs
are received, therby enforcing the current Root Bridge

Placement of Root Bridge:
	- Optimize traffic flow
		- Minimize latency
		- Minimize congestion
	- Stability and Reliability
	
Root Guard Problem:
	- Even if your root bridges priority is 0, its role can be taken by another switch with
	a lower MAC address
	- RootGaurd protects STP topoligy by preventing switches from accepting superior BPDUs
	- If you want to ensure that the root bridge remains in your LAN, you can configure
	Root Guard on the ports connected to switches outside of your control
		- "spanning-tree guard root" on desired port
		- Cannot enable by default
	- If a Root Guard enabled port receives a superior BPDU, it will enter the Broken (Root Inconsistent)
	state, effectively disabling it
		- To re-enable a port disabled by Root Guard, you must solve the issue that disabled the port
		- Ports will be automatically enabled after 20 seconds (Max Age)
