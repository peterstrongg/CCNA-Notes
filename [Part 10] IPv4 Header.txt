Packets

L3 Header: 
	- Version:
		- 4 bits
		- Identifies the verion of IP in use
			- IPv4, 4, 0100
			- IPv6, 6, 0110
	- IHL (Internet Header Length):
		- 4 bits
		- Indicates total length of the header in 4 byte increments
			- i.e. value of 5 = 5x4 = 20 bytes
			- Min value = 5 (20 bytes), ipv4 with no options
			- Max value = 15 (60 bytes) (1111)
	- DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)
		- 6 bits
		- Used for QoS (Quality of Service)
		- Used to prioritize delay-sensitive data (streaming, voice, video, etc.)
	- ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification):
		- 2 bits
		- Provides end to end notification of network congestion
		- Optional field
	- Total length field
		- 16 bits
		- Indicates total length of the packet (L3 header + L4 segments)
		- Measured in bytes
		- Min bytes = 20
		- Max bytes = 65535
	- Identifcation Field
		- 16 bits
		- If a packet is fragmented due to being too large, this field is used to identify which packet the fragment belongs to
		- Packets are fragmented if larger than MTU (Maximum transmissable unit), usually 1500 bytes
		- Fragments are reassembled by the receiving host
	- Flags
		- 3 bits
		- Bit 0: Reserved, always 0
		- Bit 1: Dont Fragment bit, used to indicate a packet that should not be fragmented
		- Bit 2: More Fragments (MF) 1 if more fragments, 0 if no more
	- Fragment offset field
		- 13 bits
		- Used to indicate the position of the fragment within the original unfragmented packet
	- TTL
		- 8 bits
		- Routers will drop ttls of 0
		- Prevents infinite loops
		- Indicates a hop count
		- Recommended default is 64
	- Protocol
		- 8 bits
		- Indicates the protocol of encapsulated L4 PDU
		- 6 = TCP
		- 17 = UDP
		- 1 = ICMP
		- 89 = OSPF (Open shortest path first)
	- Header Checksum
		- 16 bits
		- Used to check for errors in  the IPv4 header
		- Router calculates the checksum of the header and compares it to the one in this field
		- if no match, then router drops packet
		- Only for IPv4 errors
	- Src/Dest IPs
		- 32 bits each
	- Options
		- optional
		- 0-320 bits
		- Rarely used
		- If the IHL is greater than 5, it means that options are present
