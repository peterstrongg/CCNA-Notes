Default Gateway (Router):
	- To send packets to destinations outside of their local network, PCs must send packets to their
	default gateway (gateway = router)
	- default gateway aka default router
		- A route to 0.0.0.0/0 (0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255)
		- Default route is the least  specific route
	
Static Route Configuration:
	- When a router recieves a frame, it de-encapsulates it and looks at the inside packet
	- Each route in a path needs two routes for two way reachability
	
	- "ip route <dest-ip-address-prefix> <dest-netmask> <next-hop-ip OR exit-interface OR both>" (interface first) : configure a hop
	- src/dest MACs change on each hop but src/dest IPs stay the same
	
Default Routes: 
	- route to 0.0.0.0/0
	- Least specific route possible
	- Commonly used to route traffic to the internet
	- * = candidate for default route
