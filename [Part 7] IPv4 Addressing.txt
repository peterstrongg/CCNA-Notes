Layer 3 (Network Layer):
	- Provides connectivity between end-hosts on different networks
	- Provides logical addressing (IP Addresses)
	- Provides path selection between source and destination
	- Routers
	
IPv4 Addresses:
	- 32 bits/4 bytes
	- 4 octets
	- Each octet represents 8 bits written as 8 zeroes/ones
	- Dotted decimal format
	
Binary: 
	- 0s and 1s
	
CIDR: 
	- /24 = first 24 bits are the network portion of IP

IPv4 Address Classes: 
	- Determined by first octet of IP
	- Class A:
		- 0xxxxxxx
		- 0-127(126)
			- 127 is reserved for loopback addresses
		- Prefix Length: /8
	- Class B:
		- 10xxxxxx
		- 128-191
		- Prefix Length: /16
	- Class C:
		- 110xxxxx
		- 192-223
		- Prefix Length: /24
	- Class D
		- 1110xxxx
		- 224-239
		- Multicast addresses
	- Class E:
		- 1111xxxx
		- 240-255
		- Experimental
		
Netmask: 
	- Class A:	/8		255.0.0.0 	
	- Class B: 	/16		255.255.0.0
	- Class C: 	/24		255.255.255.0
	- 0s = network portion
	- Network address = first address of a network
	- First usable address is one after network address
	- Last address is broadcast address	
		- Cannot be assigned to a host
